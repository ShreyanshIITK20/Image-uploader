## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/ShreyanshIITK20/Image-uploader/blob/main/public/images/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)
This was a great starter challenge for beginner full-stack developers which tested both templating and JS skills. 
Creating a ```drop-box``` was kinda fun but at the same time it posed a great challenge to link the dropped/dragged image to a entire new webpage. It introduced me to the concept of ```localStorage``` which retains the information of uploaded files for the entire browsing session. Few bugs were observed when rerouting to root (/), and I tried my best to resolve them. However, this app is open to suggessions and improvements.
